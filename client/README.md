## Description

append(Friend) is a social networking app that connects developers. It’s not about what you know, it’s about who you know.” Networking is the key to success in all fields of work and study. Whether it be for friendships or help with projects, personal or professional, there should be a faster way to network. We want to streamline the networking process for web developers of all kinds.

In order to achieve this goal, we incorporated everything we have learned until this point to create a Full M.E.R.N stack application.
